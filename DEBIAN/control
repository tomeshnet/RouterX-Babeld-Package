Description: Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for 
 IPv6 and IPv4 with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas 
 in DSDV, AODV and Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in 
 wired networks but also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended 
 with support for overlay networks. Babel is in the process of becoming an 
 IETF Standard.
